# Manga Store API

## Description

The Manga Store API web application provides a dynamic platform to showcase a collection of mangas. Utilizing Vue.js for front-end interactivity, this project offers users a detailed view of each manga, including titles, publication dates, and ratings. The application is designed to fetch data from a local bookstore API, enriching the user experience with engaging content.

## Features

- **Browse Mangas**: Users can explore a list of mangas, complete with thumbnails and brief descriptions.
- **Detailed Manga Information**: Clicking on a manga title reveals detailed information, such as the mangaka (author), number of pages, average rating, and a teaser sentence.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts seamlessly across different devices, ensuring a consistent user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Informative error messages guide users when data fetching fails or if no information is available.
